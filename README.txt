This is a temporary fork of the official Shibboleth plugin available at
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/shibboleth/

It has several fixes for Multisite users stemming from the fact that it
stores its plugin settings globally rather that at the site level.

See shibboleth/readme.txt for more details.
